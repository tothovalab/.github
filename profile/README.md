## Welcome to the Tothova Lab!

We are a group of physicians and scientists who are passionate about tackling important questions in cancer biology with the goal to improve outcomes for cancer patients. Our research focuses on genetics and epigenetics of blood cancers, especially myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We are very committed to training the next generation of physician scientists, and are embedded within a rich community of research and clinical collaborators at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, Broad Institute, MIT, Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital.

This github includes analyses and pipelines developed by the computational biologists in the lab
